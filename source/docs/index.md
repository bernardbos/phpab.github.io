# Documentation

This is the documentation index. In this documentation we will explain the usage
of PhpAb. We will describe design of the library and all the components it exists
of.

Before you go into depth it's important to realize what A/B testing is and how it
works.

## Understanding A/B testing

A/B testing, sometimes also called bucket tests or split-run testing, is a way
to run an experiment with two variants, A and B. A and B are also called the
control and the variation.

The goal is to run an experiment and analyze with variation has an outcome that
meets the requirements most. Requirements can variate a lot and totally depend on
the business case. One could use A/B testing for user experience for example. But
one could also apply A/B testing to technical problems to see which version of an
application performs better for example.

## Multivariate testing

Multivariate testing is very similar to A/B testing with a difference that one
runs multiple variants in an experiment. This library also supports multivariate
testing.
